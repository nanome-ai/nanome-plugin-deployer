# Auto Deploy the Nanome Starter Stack

A quick script to deploy the Nanome Starter Stack

## Nanome Starter Stack Deployment Instructions

In order to successfully complete the deployment of Nanomeâ€™s starter stack group of plugins, you will need to verify that your license is Stack Enabled and you have the Stacks Configuration details in-hand (consists of an IP address and a port).

For Non-Enterprise Customers, please verify that your Nanome Licenses are _Stacks Enabled_ with your Nanome representative.

As of March 17, 2020 - the plugins a part of the Starter Stack are:

- Chemical Properties - cheminformatics calculation using RDKit
- Docking - using Smina software
- Real-Time Atom Scoring - using DSX software
- RMSD - structural alignment
- Structure Prep - re-calculate bonds and ribbons for Quest users
- Vault - web-based file management (perfect for Quest)

### Step 1: Provisioning the Dedicated Stack/Plugins Virtual Machine

Specifications:
Amazon AWS T2.medium EC2 Linux machine with 30 GB of disk storage or equivalent

Equivalent

- A Linux based operation system (Ubuntu or CentOS)
- 2 CPU - equiv. to an Intel Broadwell E5-2686v4 or higher
- 4GB of RAM
- 30GB of Storage space

Security Groups:

Configure the security groups to allow the following traffic:
SSH Port 22
HTTP Port 80

### Step 2: SSH into the VM + Install Git & Docker

SSH into the VM using the IP address and the user

```sh
ssh ec2-user@<ip-address>

sudo yum install git
sudo yum install docker
sudo service docker start
```

### Step 3: Pull the Nanome Starter Stack auto-deploy script and run it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nanome-ai/plugin-deployer
cd plugin-deployer

sudo ./deploy.sh -a <your Nanome Stacks Config IP> -p <your Nanome Stacks Config port> --plugin vault -w 80 -u <your VM Host IP>
```

*Where the Nanome Vault webUI (-w) is web interface port 80, and (-u) specifies the IP address of your current VM.
*Make sure to configure your Virtual machine to have the web interface port (80 defaults) to have the security group configured to allow TCP custom port traffic (from 0.0.0.0/0 default).

NOTE: to add arguments specific to a plugin, append any number of `--plugin <plugin-name> [args]` to the `./deploy.sh` command.

### Step 4: Docker Container Health Check

Now check to make sure all the docker containers are working properly

```sh
docker ps
```

This should list out the plugins that are currently running. Please verify that none of the containers in the column labeled 'X' has a "restarting (x sec)".

### Step 5: Validate the connection from the VR client

Go ahead and log onto the VR client computer and launch Nanome

\*Note the VR Client computer and the dedicated Stacks/Plugins VM need to be a part of the same IT firewall network
