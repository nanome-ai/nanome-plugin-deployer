## Nanome Starter Stack Deployment Instructions

In order to successfully complete the deployment of Nanomeâ€™s starter stack group of plugins, you will need to verify that your license is Stack Enabled and you have the Stacks Configuration details in-hand (consists of an IP address and a port).

For Non-Enterprise Customers, please verify that your Nanome Licenses are _Stacks Enabled_ with your Nanome representative.

Starter Stack Plugins include::

- 2D Chemical Preview - generate 2D chemical representations
- Chemical Interactions - calculate interactions using Arpeggio
- Chemical Properties - cheminformatics calculation using RDKit
- Docking - using Smina Docking software
- ESP - calculate electrostatic potential map.
- Hydrogens - add and remove hydrogens to selected structures within the Nanome workspace
- Minimization - run energy minimization for molecular structures
- Real-Time Atom Scoring - using DSX software
- RMSD - pairwise structural alignment
- Structure Prep - re-calculate bonds and ribbons for Quest users
- Vault - web-based file management (perfect for Quest)

### Step 1: Provisioning the Dedicated Stack/Plugins Virtual Machine

Specifications:
Amazon AWS T2.medium EC2 Linux machine with 30 GB of disk storage or equivalent

Equivalent

- A Linux based operation system (Ubuntu or CentOS)
- 2 CPU - equiv. to an Intel Broadwell E5-2686v4 or higher
- 4GB of RAM
- 30GB of Storage space

Security Groups:

Configure the security groups to allow the following traffic:
SSH Port 22
HTTP Port 80

### Step 2: SSH into the VM + Install Git & Docker

SSH into the VM using the IP address and the user

```sh
ssh ec2-user@<ip-address>

sudo yum install git -y
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo service docker start
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose


```
Now Log out and back into the instance

* If you are on a CentOS machine then follow this for installing docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/

### Step 3: Pull the Nanome Starter Stack auto-deploy script and run it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nanome-ai/nanome-starter-stack
cd nanome-starter-stack
```

For a typical deployment, run the following command:
```sh
sudo ./deploy.sh -a <your Nanome Stacks Config IP> -p <your Nanome Stacks Config port> --plugin data-table -w 81 -u <your VM Host IP> --plugin vault -w 80 -u <your VM Host IP>
```

*Where the Nanome Data Table Web UI (-w) is on port 81, Nanome Vault Web UI (-w) is on port 80, and (-u) specifies the IP address of your current VM.
*Make sure to configure your Virtual machine to have the ports 80 and 81 to have the security group configured to allow TCP custom port traffic (from 0.0.0.0/0 default).

NOTE: to add arguments specific to a plugin, append any number of `--plugin <plugin-name> [args]` to the `./deploy.sh` command.

Advanced: If you wish to enable git-ops style deployments, you can replace `./deploy.sh` with `./remote_deploy.sh` in the command above. Remote deploy will clone the plugin repositories using bare repos, which allows you to push changes to the repo. When a change is received, it uses git hooks to build and deploy your latest changes.

### Step 4: Docker Container Health Check

Now check to make sure all the docker containers are working properly

```sh
docker ps
```

This should list out the plugins that are currently running. Please verify that none of the containers in the column labeled 'X' has a "restarting (x sec)".

### Step 5: Validate the connection from the VR client

Go ahead and log onto the VR client computer and launch Nanome

\*Note the VR Client computer and the dedicated Stacks/Plugins VM need to be a part of the same IT firewall network


#### Proxy support
If you are unable to deploy the starter stacks script alongside your proxy. Please use the following set of commands to get things up and running

```
export http_proxy=<http://xxxxxxx:xxxx>
export https_proxy=<https://xxxxxxx:xxxx>
mkdir ~/.docker
cat > ~/.docker/config.json <<EOM
{
  "proxies": {
    "default": {
      "httpProxy": "$http_proxy",
      "httpsProxy": "$https_proxy"
    }
  }
}
EOM
cat > http-proxy.conf <<EOM
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=$https_proxy"
EOM
sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
sudo mv http-proxy.conf /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

*Note that most large organizations may not use https behind their network and so the https field of the proxy is the same as the http url.
